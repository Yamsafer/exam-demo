# Largest Element

## Task Description

The largest number in an array is the number that is strictly greater than or equal to all other numbers in the array.

Write a function:

```
function solution(arr) {
  ...YOU_CODE_HERE
}
```

that, given a zero-indexed unsorted array A consisting of N integers where N >= 1, returns the largest number in A 

For example:
* given array A = [5,8,-1,7,9], the solution should return 9
* given array A = [4,4,4,4] the solution should return 4
* given array A = [3,3,9,2] the solution should return 9
* given array A= [9] the solution should return 9

Assume that:
* N is integer within the range [1..1,000]
* each element of array A is an integer within the range [-2147483648..2147483648].
